            <h2 class="Achievement-1">Achievement</h2>
            <h3 class="Achievement-2"> Narendra Modi has achieved a number of things during his time as Prime Minister
                of India, including:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Economic growth: </strong>India's economy has grown at an average rate of 7% per year under
                    Modi's leadership. This has helped to lift millions of people out of poverty.</li>

                <li><strong> Infrastructure development:</strong> Modi has invested heavily in infrastructure
                    development, including roads, railways, and airports. This has made it easier for businesses to
                    operate and has improved the quality of life for many Indians.</li>

                <li><strong> Social welfare programs: </strong>Modi has implemented a number of social welfare programs,
                    such as the Swachh Bharat Mission (Clean India Mission) and the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana
                    (Prime Minister's People's Wealth Scheme). These programs have helped to improve the lives of
                    millions of poor and marginalized Indians.</li>

                <li><strong> Foreign policy: </strong>Modi has pursued a more assertive foreign policy than his
                    predecessors. He has strengthened ties with the United States and other Western countries, while
                    also maintaining close relations with Russia and China.</li>

            </ul>
            <h3 class="Achievement-2">Some of Modi's other specific achievements include:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li> <strong>GST: </strong>Modi's government introduced the Goods and Services Tax (GST) in 2017. This
                    is India's biggest tax reform since independence and has helped to simplify the tax system and boost
                    economic growth.</li>

                <li><strong> Jan Dhan Yojana: </strong>The Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (Prime Minister's People's
                    Wealth Scheme) was launched in 2014 to provide bank accounts to all Indians. This has helped to
                    bring millions of people into the formal financial system.</li>

                <li><strong> Swachh Bharat Mission:</strong> The Swachh Bharat Mission (Clean India Mission) was
                    launched in 2014 to improve sanitation and hygiene in India. The mission has helped to build
                    millions of toilets and has made India a cleaner country.</li>

                <li> <strong>Ayushman Bharat:</strong> The Ayushman Bharat Yojana (Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana) is
                    a national health insurance scheme that was launched in 2018. The scheme provides coverage to over
                    500 million Indians and is one of the largest healthcare programs in the world.</li>
